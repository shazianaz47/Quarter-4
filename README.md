## How LLMs Work
Large Language Models follow these steps:

1. **Tokenization** – breaking text into small units  
2. **Embedding** – converting tokens to numeric vectors  
3. **Self-Attention** – understanding relationships between words  
4. **Training** – predicting the next token  
5. **Generation** – creating text based on probabilities
